        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This broccoli salad with bacon and cheese is requested at every 
            family gathering. Let it be your next dish that they crave! I like 
            this dish to be prepared at least two hours before serving. Be sure 
            to have copies of the recipe on hand, as everyone will ask for it!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices bacon</li>
            <li>2 heads fresh broccoli, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>½ large red onion, chopped</li>
            <li>⅔ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>⅛ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until crisp and evenly browned, 
                8-10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and crumble when cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Combine bacon, broccoli, cheese, and onion in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk mayonnaise, red wine vinegar, sugar, pepper, salt, and lemon juice together in a small 
                bowl; pour over salad and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
