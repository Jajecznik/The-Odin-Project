                The first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by Italian 
                Giovanni da Verrazzano, an explorer from Florence in the service of the French crown. 
                He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoulême (New Angoulême). 
                A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V, 
                arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, 
                which he named Río de San Antonio ('Saint Anthony's River'). The Padrón Real of 1527, 
                the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously, was informed by Gomes' 
                expedition and labeled the northeastern United States as Tierra de Esteban Gómez in his honor.
